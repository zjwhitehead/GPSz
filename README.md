This is a school project 
------------------------

That means I retain all available rights to this and all related files.

I will be updating this README as I add features and change things around

For now you can
* Look up locations using the Google Maps Geocode API
* View all locations on Google Maps
* Create Edit and Destroy locations

<i>If you have any suggestions email myself @ zjwhitehead@hotmail.com </i>
